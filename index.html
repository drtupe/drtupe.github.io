											<h1>Hi, I’m Dheeraj Tupe</h1>
											<p><b>Welcome to my Portfolio</b></p>
										</header>
										<p>I'm an Automotive Engineer currently based in Marseille, France. I have a passion for Automobiles and coding, I get most enjoyment from reading and trying hands on implementation on new ideas and testing them for validations. I love learning new things, so I always keeping myself upto date by watching conference talks, listening to podcasts and reading blog posts about various things.<br><br>
										   This Portfolio is showcase of my completed projects which I have worked on to gain experience and brush-up my skills which I have learned throught out my career. Feel free to explore these projects and dont hesitate to contact me if in doubt or even to drop some suggestion to improve these projects further.

												<h3>MATLAB/Simulink</h3>
												<p>As in the automotive industry, Matlab/Simulink is the tool par excellence for MBD: the architecture of the software is designed using Simulink and refined until a level of detail where code can be used.</p>

											<span class="icon solid fa-paper-plane"></span>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>Python</h3>
												<p>Mechanical and automobile industries use python to automate tasks. Even when the script is written in another programming language, it is rewritten in Python before automation since it is the most common language and hence the interface between industries and codes.</p>

											<span class="icon solid fa-rocket"></span>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>C++</h3>
												<p>C++ and the automotive industry have become deeply intertwined over the last four decades. In the early 80s, engineers used C (the predecessor of C++) to make electronically controlled ignition and fuel injection systems, and today electronics comprise 35% of the car’s price.</p>

												<h3>ROS</h3>
												<p>ROS stands for - Robotic Operation Systems, as the name suggests it is a flexiable framework for writing robot software.  It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.</p>

											<h3>Udacity</h3>
											<a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/PEEKGDQJ" class="image"><embed src="images/udacity.pdf" /></a>
											<p>In this program, I learnt the techniques that power self-driving cars across the full stack of a vehicle’s autonomous capabilities. Using Deep Learning with radar and lidar sensor fusion, I was able to train the vehicle to detect and identify its surroundings to inform navigation.</p>

											<h3>Reinforcement Learning Virtual School</h3>
											<a href="https://rlvs.aniti.fr/" class="image"><embed src="images/rlvs (376).pdf" /></a>
											<p>This event was 100% online and the program of the school consisted of about 6 Days of lectures, hands-on sessions, and research talks (mix of theory and practice), with the goal of	providing an easy access to the field of Reinforcement Learning to new researchers in the field.</p>
